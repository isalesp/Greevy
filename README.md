In this repository I upload the Jupyter Notebook I worked on in the Analizing Data with Python course by IBM. 
I used libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, applied data wrangling, EDA, model development, model evaluation and
put them into practice to make predictions on this final project in a Jupyter Notebook on Watson Studio.
